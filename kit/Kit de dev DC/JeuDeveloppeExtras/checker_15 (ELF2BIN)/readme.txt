What's new?
-----------
Version 1.5
ELF2BIN support added.  Right click integration for ELF files.  Option to convert
to scrambled or unscrambled binary, in 1 step.

Version 1.4
I thought I'd update this program, since it kinda annoyed me that right-click
integration wasn't already a feature.  I went ahead and added that and support
for a few of the older demos it didn't yet support.  This is be the only
version you'll ever need, unless someone releases a new binary that isn't
support, yet at the same time, could be.

File naming for scrambling and unscrambling has change again.  This time it's
a lot easier to find that scrambled or unscrambled binary, because it should
be right next to the original file.  The files are now name like 
1st_read_unscrambled.bin instead of (unscrambled)1st_read.bin.

Sadly enough, Beats of Rage isn't supported.  Although the TMNT mod hack by
Ian Micheal is supported.
